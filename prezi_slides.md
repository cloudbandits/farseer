# FARSEER CI/CD Pipeline: A Deep Dive

## 🚀 Pipeline Architecture

### Build Node Evolution
- **Initial Challenge**: Insufficient system resources
- **Solution**: Upgraded build node specifications
  - Increased CPU cores
  - Added RAM
  - Enhanced network bandwidth
  - Optimized for containerization workloads

### Credential Management
- Secure credential injection using Jenkins Credential Manager
- Credentials used:
  - Docker Hub credentials
  - AWS Access Keys
  - External API Keys
  - SonarQube Token

## 🔄 Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build Stage
- Executes frontend and backend build scripts
- Prepares application components

### 2. Build & Push Images
- Builds Docker images for frontend and backend
- Injects API keys during image creation
- Pushes images to Docker Hub
- Uses dynamic tagging (`:latest`)

### 3. Deployment Strategy
- **Branch-Based Deployment**
  - `production` → Production Environment
  - `qa` → Testing Environment
  - `develop` → Staging Environment
  - `feature/*` → Development Environment

### 4. Infrastructure as Code
- Uses Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Dynamically passes credentials
- Supports multiple environment configurations

## 🛡️ Security and Code Quality Assurance
- Integration of SonarQube for security vulnerability scanning and code quality analysis
- SonarQube checks for:
  - Security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
  - Code quality metrics (duplication, complexity, best practices)
  - Technical debt identification
- Quality gate enforcement to ensure code meets defined standards before deployment

## 🛡️ Additional Security & Optimization
- Secure credential management using Jenkins Credential Manager
- Automated cleanup of system resources
- Docker system pruning
- Git workspace cleaning

## 🔗 Webhook Integration
- Webhook created between Jenkins and GitHub repository
- Automatic pipeline trigger on code push
- Supports branch-specific workflows
