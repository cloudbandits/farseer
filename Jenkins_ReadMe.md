# FARSEER CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview
FARSEER is a comprehensive continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline designed to automate software build, test, and deployment processes across multiple environments. A key focus of the pipeline is on ensuring the security and quality of the codebase through the integration of SonarQube.

## Key Features
- Multi-environment deployment (Production, QA, Development)
- Docker image building and pushing
- Automated infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Secure credential management
- SonarQube-based code security and quality analysis

## Environment Branches
- `production`: Deployed to Production Environment
- `qa`: Deployed to Testing Environment
- `develop`: Deployed to Staging Environment
- `feature/*`: Deployed to Development Environment

## Security and Code Quality
The FARSEER CI/CD pipeline places a strong emphasis on security and code quality through the integration of SonarQube. SonarQube is a powerful open-source tool that helps identify and track technical debt, code quality, and security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

The pipeline includes a dedicated stage for running SonarQube code analysis, which performs the following key actions:

1. **Security Vulnerability Scanning**: SonarQube scans the codebase for known security vulnerabilities, such as those defined by the OWASP Top 10, and reports on their severity and prevalence.
2. **Code Quality Analysis**: SonarQube evaluates the overall code quality, including metrics like code duplication, code complexity, and adherence to best practices.
3. **Technical Debt Tracking**: SonarQube identifies areas of the codebase that may require refactoring or optimization, helping to manage technical debt over time.
4. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: The pipeline includes a step that waits for the SonarQube quality gate to be evaluated, ensuring that the code meets the defined quality standards before proceeding with deployment.

By integrating SonarQube into the CI/CD pipeline, the FARSEER project benefits from early detection of security and quality issues, improved code maintainability, and a consistent level of code quality across the entire codebase.
